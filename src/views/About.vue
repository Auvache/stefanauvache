        <p>When I found out that I was going to be a dad, my life changed forever. </p>
        <p>I realized that a little person was going to watch my every move, and that I needed to start acting with more intention. We influence those around us with our actions. If we are to influence the world for good, we must start by being good ourselves.</p>
        <p>In my pursuit of personal betterment, I have found universal, practical principles that catalyze improvement across disciplines. Principles of software engineering can strengthen relationships. Business management philosophies can help improve your abilities as an athlete, writer, or parent.</p>
        <p>My goal is to take the tools, principles, and philosophies that have most benefited my character, and to share them with everyone I can.</p>
