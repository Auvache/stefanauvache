            <h1>Follow Mental Health Naps</h1>
            <p>I hope that you have found helpful information, comfort, and giggles while reading my journey living with severe sleep apnea and managing my mental health with a CPAP. But, did you know Mental Health Naps is more than a blog?  </p>
            <p>You can find additional video and visual content on TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, and YouTube. Though I only post a blog once a week, I post on those social media platforms Monday thru Friday. I encourage you to follow me there for more daily Sleep Apnea and Mental Health content.</p>
