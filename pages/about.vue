	      <p>What happens when you work hard to achieve something only to realize that you didn’t want that thing in the first place? How can you possibly know if you truly want something if you’ve never experienced it before?</p>
	      <p>We can find the answers to these questions by studying how timeless principles are used by successful people in modern times.</p>
        <p>Principles from technology, business, and project management can be applied directly to our daily lives to help us orient ourselves and move forward.</p>
	      <p>By exploring these universal patterns&mdash;iterative development, systems for productivity, taking action&mdash;I help readers develop their own systems for personal improvement.</p>
