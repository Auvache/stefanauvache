				<p>
					Personal growth can be an overwhelming topic to tackle. There are so many books, frameworks, and voices offering advice that it’s hard to know where to begin.
					The most useful way that I’ve found to approach self-improvement is to step back and ask big questions.
				</p>

				<p>
					This page is organized around some of those questions:
				</p>

				<ul class="list-unstyled">
					<li>
						<NuxtLink to="/articles/purpose-and-meaning">
							How can I find purpose and meaning?
						</NuxtLink>
					</li>
					<li>
						<NuxtLink to="/articles/live-with-intention">
							How can I act with more intention?
						</NuxtLink>
					</li>
					<li>
						<NuxtLink to="/articles/stay-motivated-productive">
							How can I stay motivated and productive?
						</NuxtLink>
					</li>
					<li>
						<NuxtLink to="/articles/learn-improve-skills">
							How can I learn and improve my skills?
						</NuxtLink>
					</li>
					<li>
						<NuxtLink to="/articles/practical-tools-frameworks">
							What practical tools and frameworks can help me improve?
						</NuxtLink>
					</li>
					<li>
						<NuxtLink to="/articles/reading-self-improvement">
							What should I read to better myself?
						</NuxtLink>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
					Each section below shows a collection of articles that approach these questions from various angles.
					They draw on lessons from software engineering, business, and my personal experiences.
