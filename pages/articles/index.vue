				<p>I write about Agile Personal Development—applying software engineering principles to build a more intentional, fulfilling life.</p>

				<p>At 30, my life looks nothing like I planned at 18—and that's a good thing. I accidentally discovered that the same iterative thinking I used as a software engineer worked better for life decisions than rigid planning. Now I explore this approach publicly, testing what works and sharing what I learn.</p>

				<p>These articles cover five core areas: applying Agile principles to personal growth, learning through iteration and experimentation, navigating the Destination Dilemma when you don't know what you want, building systems that create space for what matters, and turning failure into fuel for improvement. Whether you're uncertain about your direction, unsatisfied despite achieving goals, or overly certain about untested plans, you'll find frameworks for building a more intentional life.</p>
