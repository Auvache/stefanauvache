				<h2>How to make decisions and build a fulfilling life when you don't know what you want.</h2>
				<p>How can you plan for what you haven't experienced? Most people lock into goals—career paths, relationships, lifestyles—without testing whether those goals will actually bring fulfillment. They achieve success but wonder why it feels hollow.</p>
				<p>The Destination Dilemma is the gap between achievement and satisfaction. You can't know what you truly want until you've lived it, yet you're expected to commit to major life decisions based on imagination alone. The solution isn't more planning—it's iteration. Test your assumptions, gather real data about what brings you satisfaction, and adjust your direction based on experience rather than guesswork.</p>
				<p class="pb-4">These articles explore how to navigate uncertainty, align your life with your values, and build fulfillment through experimentation. Whether you're unsure what career fits you, unsatisfied despite achieving your goals, or overly certain about plans you haven't tested, you'll find frameworks for making better decisions when the destination isn't clear.</p>
