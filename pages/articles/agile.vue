				<h2>Apply software engineering principles to build a more intentional, fulfilling life.</h2>
				<p>Software developers use Agile thinking to build better products through iteration, feedback, and continuous improvement. These same principles can transform how you approach personal growth, productivity, and decision-making.</p>
				<p>In software engineering, teams work in short cycles—planning, building, measuring results, and adjusting based on what they learn. This iterative approach prevents wasted effort on the wrong solutions and keeps teams focused on what actually works. The same framework applies to life: instead of committing to rigid plans without testing them, you can iterate your way toward clarity.</p>
				<p class="pb-4">Whether you're working to overcome perfectionism, manage unplanned work, or simply want to think more systematically about your goals, these articles show you how engineering principles translate to everyday life. You don't need to be technical to benefit—these concepts work for anyone who wants to build a more deliberate, fulfilling life through experimentation rather than guesswork.</p>
