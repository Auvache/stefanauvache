	      <p>Some tasks engage and energize us; others give our work meaning. Unfortunately, these tasks are often buried under a stack of less important items that crowd our to-do lists and demand our attention.</p>
	      <p>Whenever I feel overwhelmed by the workload in front of me, I rely on a simple task management framework to reduce stress, clean out my to-dos, and refocus on what truly matters.</p>
	      <p>The framework:<br>
		      Eliminate, Automate, Delegate, Do.</p>

	      <h2>Eliminate</h2>
	      <p>What tasks can simply not be done?</p>
	      <p>What if you didn’t attend that meeting? What if you stopped managing your social media presence, let a few tasks go unfinished, or ignored your metrics for a week? What if you stopped replying to every email like it was urgent?</p>
	      <p>We waste an incredible amount of time doing things that don’t matter. Most people aren’t overwhelmed because they’re doing too many hard things—they’re overwhelmed because they’re doing too many <em>unnecessary</em> things.</p>
	      <p>I ask myself almost every day: <em>What on my to-do list can I simply not do?</em> Not delegate, not delay—just delete.</p>

	      <h2>Automate</h2>
	      <p>If it has to be done, can it be automated?</p>
	      <p>Automation isn’t just for coders—it’s for anyone who’s tired of wasting time. We often tolerate small, repetitive tasks because they don’t seem worth fixing. But over time, they add up. Manually paying bills, copying data between spreadsheets, transcribing meeting notes, sending reminder emails—these are all examples of low-leverage tasks that quietly drain your time and energy.</p>
	      <p>Every minute saved is a minute you can reinvest into meaningful work. Automation is the modern version of delegation. You can give much of your workload to a process that never sleeps, forgets, or complains.</p>
	      <p>If a task happens more than once, it deserves a system. That system might be as simple as an email filter, a calendar reminder, a template, or a script. You don’t need to be technical to automate—you just need to be willing to step back and ask: <em>Do I really need to do this manually again?</em></p>
	      <p>The tools are out there—bank auto-pay, Zapier, Notion templates, Google Sheets formulas, AI transcription, smart reminders. Use them. Free yourself from digital drudgery, and let your systems do the boring stuff.</p>

	      <h2>Delegate</h2>
	      <p>If a task can’t be automated, can it be delegated?</p>
	      <p>Is this something that needs to get done but doesn’t necessarily require your direct involvement?</p>
	      <p>Often, others may be more efficient, better equipped, or have greater bandwidth to handle certain tasks. They might have already completed similar work or possess the expertise to do it more effectively. Delegation means giving a task to someone else and trusting them to get it done without you having to be involved in all or most of the work, and it is a great tool for emptying your to-do list.</p>
	      <p>Avoid offloading tasks onto others out of laziness. If you genuinely need assistance, ask for help. Collaborate and leverage the strengths of those around you to accomplish work effectively.</p>

	      <h2>Do</h2>
	      <p>Now, get to work.</p>
	      <p>You should have a clear, shortened list of tasks to accomplish. Set aside dedicated blocks of time, eliminate distractions, and focus on your work. Group similar tasks together — for example, answer all your emails in one session.</p>
	      <p>Avoid multitasking. When you’re crafting a presentation, debugging code, or designing, resist the urge to respond to messages or switch tasks. Concentrate fully on one task at a time, and channel your energy into doing it well.</p>

	      <hr>

	      <p>I use this system to clear my mind and focus on what truly matters each day. It’s a straightforward, sustainable, and practical framework for zeroing in on the most important work you need to do right now. You, too, can use it to spend less time bogged down by unimportant tasks and more time doing meaningful work.<br>
		      Eliminate. Automate. Delegate. Do.</p>
