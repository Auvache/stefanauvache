				<p>I'm Stefan Auvache, and I write about Agile Personal Development.</p>
				<p>At 30, my life looks nothing like I planned at 18—and that's a good thing. I accidentally applied software engineering principles—iteration, experimentation, feedback loops—to my own life decisions and discovered a better way forward than rigid goal-setting.</p>
				<p>Now I explore that approach publicly. I write about how to iterate toward a life you actually want instead of chasing goals you're not sure about. It's for anyone who feels uncertain about what they want and tired of motivational content that assumes you already know your destination.</p>
				<p>I'm a software engineer with a Master's degree in Information Systems Management from BYU. I live in Vancouver, Washington with my family. Every week, I share one idea about building your life the way you build great software—through small experiments and thoughtful iteration.</p>
